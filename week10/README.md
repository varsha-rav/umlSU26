# Week 10 — Building Reliable Systems
Testing ci pipeline

Starter code for the Week 10 reliability lab and the running capstone. Everything
runs locally against one Kafka broker; the optional failover demo uses three.

## Prereqs

- Docker running
- A Python virtualenv:

```bash
cd week10
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start the broker and create the topics

Auto-create is off on purpose (you name your topics deliberately), so create them once:

```bash
docker compose up -d
for t in orders orders.dlq ci.images ci.images.dlq; do
  docker exec week10-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh \
    --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --create --topic "$t" \
    --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1 --if-not-exists
done
```

## Part 1 — Reliability lab (`producer.py`, `consumer.py`)

`consumer.py` is an at-least-once consumer that commits its offset **after** the
work, and shows the three patterns you write by hand this week: retry with backoff,
idempotency (a dedup check against a `ledger.txt`), and dead-letter routing.

**Redelivery + idempotency.** `RESET=1` starts a demo over (rewind to the first
message, clear the ledger); a plain run **resumes** from where it left off — that
resume is what redelivers a killed order. `IDEMPOTENCY=off` turns the idempotency check off.

```bash
python producer.py                     # 5 orders
IDEMPOTENCY=off RESET=1 python consumer.py    # start fresh; kill it (Ctrl-C) mid-batch...
IDEMPOTENCY=off python consumer.py            # ...resume: the redelivered order applies TWICE
```

Now with idempotency on (the default), the redelivered order is skipped instead:

```bash
RESET=1 python consumer.py              # start fresh; kill mid-batch...
python consumer.py                      # ...resume: the redelivered order is skipped
```

**Dead-letter.** Inject a poison (malformed) message; the consumer retries it with
backoff, gives up, routes it to `orders.dlq`, and keeps going:

```bash
python producer.py --poison
docker exec week10-kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic orders.dlq --from-beginning --timeout-ms 4000
```

(`GROUP=<name>` overrides the consumer group if you want a fresh read from the start.)

## Part 2 — Capstone: react to your build, reliably

The Week 9 pipeline announced `ImagePushed` and stopped. Here one consumer reacts.

- **`release_gate.py`** (skeleton) reads each `ImagePushed` event, deploys the image
  (`docker pull` and run), acceptance-tests it (`GET /sum?a=1&b=2` must be `3`), and
  promotes it to `:latest` when the test passes. It does nothing when the test fails.
  The docker and HTTP helpers are written for you. You complete the consumer loop and
  the three reliability patterns (idempotency, retry with backoff, dead-letter) plus
  commit-after-processing. See Exercise 10.
- **`calculator/`** is the Spring Boot `/sum` service (Java, listens on 8080), built
  into the image the gate tests. Its `Dockerfile` and `Jenkinsfile` are included.
- **`emit_imagepushed.py`** stands in for the pipeline's announce so you can drive the
  flow without Jenkins.

The flow is `ImagePushed`, then deploy and test, then promote when it passes.

Build and announce it with the pipeline (`calculator/Jenkinsfile`, a Pipeline from SCM
job), or do it by hand:

```bash
# build and push the calculator image to the local registry (as the pipeline would)
docker build -t localhost:5001/calculator:1 calculator
docker push localhost:5001/calculator:1

python release_gate.py            # terminal 1 (after you complete it)
python emit_imagepushed.py 1      # terminal 2, watch it deploy, test, and promote
```

The gate maps the container's 8080 to host port **18080**. Change `HOST_PORT` in
`release_gate.py` if that port is taken. It needs the local registry from Week 9
(`localhost:5001`).

## Optional — survive a broker failure (Pattern 5)

A separate three-broker cluster. `demo.sh` creates a replication-factor-3 topic,
writes three messages, kills the leader, and reads them back from a survivor.

```bash
docker compose -f cluster-compose.yml -p w10 up -d
./demo.sh
docker compose -f cluster-compose.yml -p w10 down
```

Run this on its own — tear down the single-broker lab first (both want port 9092).

## Teardown

```bash
docker compose down
```
